# Restful Blog API

This is a Rest API build using MERN stack.
Here I have build a complete backend using express.

## Getting Started

First, duplicate the `.env` file into a new file named `.env.local`. Update the value of your OpenAI API key there.

The first time you are running this project, you will need to install the dependencies. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the app, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
